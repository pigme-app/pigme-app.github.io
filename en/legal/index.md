# Privacy

### Data collection

All user-created datasets are stored locally on the user's device. No transfer of data to us or any third party is performed.

### External links

When pressing a link (e.g. AppStore rating image) the user will be redirected away from the app, at which point the applicability of this privacy policy ends. Instead the user is referred to the privacy policies of the respective apps and websites (e.g. **[Apple Privacy Policy](https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/en-ww/)** for the AppStore or Safari).

### In-App-Purchases

Handling the In-App-Purchases is done by the AppStore StoreKit framework provided by Apple. Therefor, its **[Terms and Conditions](https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/us/terms.html)** and **[Privacy Policy](https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/en-ww/)** apply.

### Biometric authentication

When a PIN lock is set, the user has the ability to use biometric authentication (TouchID/FaceID) to enable quicker access to the app. The authentication is handled through frameworks of the operating system (iOS), provided by Apple, whereby no biometric data is available to or stored by the app itself. It requires the activation in the iPhone's gerneral settings and an initial acceptance at the app's first biometric authentication request. The user can, at any times, opt-out of the biometric authentication either inside the app's settings or revoke the app's ability to use biometric authentication completely inside the iPhone's general settings. See the references for **[TouchID](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201371)** and **[FaceID](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208109)** for more information.

### GitHub website policies

This website is provided using GitHub Pages. Refer to the GitHub **[website policies](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy)**.
